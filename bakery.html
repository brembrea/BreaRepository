      This is my dog, Baby. We got her for $75 on Craigslist out of the back of a ladys trunk.
      She is an unknown Chihuahua mix, and we often regard her as a minature chihuahua pinscher.
      She is about 11 years old and will probably live for 10 more years. She has had multiple near death experiences.
      She is very loved.

  Baby ate 47 full-size hair ties over the course of a year. This happened when I was in third grade right before my dad went on deployment for a year. My dad thought it would be pretty lame to tell his 8-year-old daughter that her dog was dead and then leave for a year, so we balled out and got her some surgery. She still occasionally munches on hair ties, and I have now swapped to claw clips. Baby is pretty much unkillable now and can survive anything.
